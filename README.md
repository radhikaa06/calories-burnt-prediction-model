Calories Burnt Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the number of calories burned during exercise. The model is built using Python and various data science libraries to provide accurate predictions based on fitness metrics.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to build a robust and accurate predictive model. The process involved the following key steps:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to understand relationships between variables (e.g., duration of exercise, heart rate, body temperature) and calories burned.

Model Training: Training and fine-tuning a model using supervised learning algorithms like Linear Regression and XGBoost.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance to ensure its reliability and accuracy.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the project.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For model training, evaluation, and data preprocessing.

XGBoost: A powerful gradient-boosting library used for model training.

Repository Structure
The repository is structured to be easy to navigate:

calories_project.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the complete code for data cleaning, EDA, model training, and evaluation.

exercise.csv: The dataset used to train the model.

my_model.pkl: The serialized machine learning model, ready for deployment.
