# 🏋️ Calories Burnt Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the number of calories burned during exercise. The model uses Python and popular data science libraries to provide accurate predictions based on fitness metrics.

# 🔍 Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to build a robust and reliable predictive model for calories burned. The key steps involved are:

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handling missing values and preparing the dataset for training to ensure high-quality inputs for the model.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing and analyzing data to understand relationships between variables such as exercise duration, heart rate, body temperature, and calories burned.

🤖 Model Training
Training and fine-tuning models using supervised learning algorithms, including Linear Regression and XGBoost, for optimal performance.

📈 Model Evaluation
Assessing the performance of the trained model to ensure accuracy and reliability.

# 🛠 Technologies Used

🐍 Python – Core programming language

📋 Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

🔢 NumPy – Numerical operations and array handling

📉 Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

⚙️ Scikit-learn – Model training, evaluation, and preprocessing
